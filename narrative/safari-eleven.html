<p>Classified as a cat, this is no cat that you'd want hanging around your doorstep. Natural hunters and primarily carnivore, the Lion
is one of the savannah's most feared predators. The lion's powerful jaw has teeth that are approximately 4 inches long, 1.5 inch sharp claws 
and a 7 foot, 400 plus pound frame that can crush any prey with an incredibly fast lunge.
