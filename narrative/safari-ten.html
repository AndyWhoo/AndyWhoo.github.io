	 <center><p>The Elephant is considered one of the world's largest land dwelling mammals; ranging from a height of 8 to 13 feet tall, and 6000 to 13000 pounds.Being a herbivore,an elephant
	 eats a host of foliage like bushes, tree leafs, grass, and fruit. The majority of the elephant's day is spent eating in order to stay big. they are also very social creatures, living in tightly knit families
with social hierarchy that consists of a strong female herd leader, the matriarch. Male elephants on the other hand often travel alone and are known to experience "musth", a period where the male is overflowing with testosterone 
and becomes highly aggressive, attacking anything in sight.</p></center>
