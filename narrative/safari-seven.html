	 <center><p>A strange looking animal, it almost appears to be a cross between a zebra and a deer, though it is closely related to the giraffe. Averaging at 5 feet and 400 pounds, the Okapi's diet consists of
flowers, tree leaves, fungus, and grass. Their natural habitat are forests and are able to use their striped camoflauge to blend in with the undergrowth. Their acute senses can quickly spot danger and are prone to being 
incredibly hard to locate. Okapi often travel alone and the males are very territorial.</p></center>
