	 <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
	 
	 <center><p>My work focuses on the deviation from daily routine and the abstraction of normal everyday life. People follow routine which gives our lives a sense of cohesion and structure, i have a routine which keeps me sane. However,
i believe that a little disruption is needed every once in a while, a different point of view as opposed to the same old sights and sounds we experience day after day. I tend to to focus too much on realism, i'll take what is real, and i will bend it
until the shape is physically unrecognizable. I will dabble in any medium from digital to pen and pencil, whatever i am feeling at the current time, i will utilize.</p>
