     <center><p>Sometimes, you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand back up taller than you were.</p>

	 <h2>Artist Statement</h2>

	 <center><p>My work focuses on the deviation from daily routine and the abstraction of normal everyday life. People follow routine which gives our lives a sense of cohesion and structure, I have a routine which keeps me sane. However,
I believe that a little disruption is needed every once in a while, a different point of view as opposed to the same old sights and sounds we experience day after day.I tend to take what is real, and I will bend it
until the shape is physically unrecognizable. I will dabble in any medium from digital to pen and pencil, whatever I am feeling at the current time, I will utilize.</p>
