	 <center><p>Widely believed to share a common ancestor with current day humans, the Gorilla is an ape that gets around by knuckle walking, 
	 but can sometimes walk upright in certain situations such as confrontation or carrying. They can grow up to around 6 feet tall and 400 pounds giving them a characteristic girth.For their diet, 
	 gorillas forage for food in forests, consuming fluid rich vegetation, insects, fruit and more; they are quite the herbivore. Gorillas are unfortunately highly endangered.</p></center>
