	 <center><p>Almost like a wild boar, the warthog is in the same family as pigs. Warthogs are most identifiable by 2 pairs of tusks that 
extend from their mouth and curve upwards. They use their tusks to dig into the dirt and make burrows, they also use them to defend against or attack predators/other warthog. Though not territorial, warthog wander 
on a home range that can stretch across much of africa.</p></center>
