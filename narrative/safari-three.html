	 <center><p>A pack of Hyenas are blocking the road........which is a good time to learn about Hyenas. We often associate Hyenas with devious behavior, laughing, 
	 and being all around vicious. Actually, only a few variations of hyenas laugh, such as the sriped or spotted hyena, and hey only do so to vocalize while communicating 
	 or any form of socializing. They hunt in packs like most animals in the canine family (though they have a loose canoocetion to canines) but they also scavenge for food as well,
	 preferring a carnivore's diet of meat and sometimes insects depending on the species.</p></center>
